Project Using Kafka and Implementation of DDOS attack detection  

We tried to perform the kafka problem in a different manner, we initially used kafka and got the raw data to the terminal from a web page. This activity was done in ubuntu. And we used windows OS to make a basic system to detect DDOS attacks. Currently we are taking the data from a file called sample_data.text.
